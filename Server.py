TODO:
- uninstaller
- massive test

"DONE":
- send crash error on discord

DONE:
- hebrew?
- log stuff
- the updater "doesn't send notifications"
- user is offline when they aren't
- updater
- make updating users possible without restarting MILC2
- but also make it easier to restart MILC2 than to have to kill it and then launch it through tasks
- basically make tray is what ori is trying to say here ðŸ˜¢
- also make it so that you can launch MILC2 through search
- server doesn't work after crash
- don't request admin on send
- installer doesn't work when launching without cmd :(
